This project aims to explore and analyze coffee sales trends to uncover valuable insights from a dataset of coffee sales transactions. The project leverages SQL queries and data analysis techniques to answer key questions about coffee sales performance, such as the most popular drinks, highest revenue-generating categories, and sales trends over time.

## Project Overview

The main objective of this project is to perform an in-depth analysis of coffee sales data and answer the following questions:

1. **Which coffee is the most popular?**
2. **Which coffee category generates the most revenue?**
3. **What time of day sees the most coffee orders?**
4. **What is the total revenue generated during the entire period?**
5. **What is the average selling price for each coffee?**
6. **Which coffee drinks are the highest earners on a yearly basis?**

The analysis utilizes SQL queries to process the data and present results based on various factors, including sales revenue, order frequency, time of day, and more.
